## Description
This task covered the initial setup of the foundational components of the application. It involved establishing connections to external data sources (Google Sheets and Redis) and creating the service wrappers and data models required for interaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `GoogleSheetsService` exists that can read from and write to Google Sheets, with appropriate retry logic.
- A `RedisStorageService` exists that can store and retrieve Pydantic models and other data types in Redis.
- Core Pydantic models (`Question`, `Employee`, `FeedbackCycle`, etc.) are defined in `storage/models.py`.
- Application configuration for connecting to these services is handled via `pydantic-settings`.
- The main application entry point (`__main__.py`) correctly initializes these services.

## Definition of Done
- Code for services and models is implemented.
- Configuration is externalized to environment variables.
- The application can successfully connect to both Redis and Google Sheets on startup.
- All related code is committed to the repository.
