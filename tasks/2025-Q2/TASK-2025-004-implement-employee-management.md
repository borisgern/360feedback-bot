## Description
Created the `EmployeeService` to manage loading, accessing, and updating employee information. This service acts as the single source of truth for employee data within the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `EmployeeService` loads the full employee list from the "Employees" Google Sheet at startup.
- The service maintains in-memory maps for fast lookups by employee ID and Telegram ID.
- A `register_telegram_id` method is available to link a user's Telegram ID to their employee profile when they first interact with the bot.
- This linkage is persisted in Redis to survive application restarts.
- Other services can reliably get employee data using `find_by_id` and `find_by_telegram_id`.

## Definition of Done
- `EmployeeService` is fully implemented and integrated into the application.
- The application correctly loads employee data on startup.
- Telegram ID registration is working as expected.
- Code is committed.
